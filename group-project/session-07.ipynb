With this set of input data and imported libraries, achieveing parallelization with the `ThreadPoolExecutor` is largely limited by python's \"global interpreter lock\". This is a lock that allows only 1 thread to hold control of the python interpreter. One way to avoid the global interpreter lock is to use multi-processing approach, rather than a multi-threaded approach. This works because each python process gets its own interpreter and memory space. This is exactly what we are doing with the `HighThroughputExecutor`! This executor coordinates tasks over several cores in a node.\n",
