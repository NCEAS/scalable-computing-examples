With this set of input data and imported libraries, achieveing parallelization with the `ThreadPoolExecutor` is largely limited by python's \"global interpreter lock\". This is a lock that allows only 1 thread to hold control of the python interpreter. One way to avoid the global interpreter lock is to use multi-processing approach, rather than a multi-threaded approach. This works because each python process gets its own interpreter and memory space. This is exactly what we are doing with the `HighThroughputExecutor`! This executor coordinates tasks over several cores in a node.\n",

    "This process took the original 11 files, ranging in size from 6 MB to 88 MB (all files = about 0.5 GB), and tiled them into 454 geopackage files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Discuss in your groups whether you suspect this process is CPU bound, I/O bound, memory bound, or network bound. \n",
    "\n",
    "How would you figure it out for sure?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would you want to know?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "This process seems to be I/O bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rule out memory bound, since the total data to process is ~0.5 GB and the memory on our server is much greater than that (126 GB). It is also not network bound, since all of the data are local to our process, and don't need to be transferred at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leaves CPU or I/O bound. One way to test whether the process is CPU bound is to see if adding more workers (CPU power) decreases the computation time. Spoiler: it doesn't! If you increase the number of workers in the executor, the process still takes the same amount of minutes to finish. Additionally, the CPU load and CPU utilization remain approximately the same. To check out the CPU load during a process (amongst other stats) the command line `dstat` is helpful. I like `dstat -a --load` to look at CPU load specifically.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we are leaning towards I/O bound, which makes sense, given that we are reading in some decently sized files, and then having to write out a whole bunch of files. How can we confirm? The commandline tool `iostat` (`iostat -kx 1`) will show the percentage of CPU time during which I/O requests are sent in the `%util` column. A high percentage here is a potential indicator that your process is I/O limited. Other stats to look at are the disk latency and request wait time, both of which are indicators that the process is waiting a while for things to finish writing to disk. The way to test all this, of course, would be to run the process on a machine with a faster disk to see if you can decrease your process time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for why we would want to know this, if we wanted to speed up our process, and it is I/O bound, throwing more CPU at it will not make it faster (as just discussed). So it is important to know the nature of the problem, so that you can address it appropriately.\n"

    "## Bonus 2\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you test whether step 2 is CPU or I/O bound? One option would be to test whether adding more CPU decreases your computation time. Set up a test on a subset of the staged files (the first 100 or so is fine) and time the process at different `max_workers_per_node`. To make sure you don't overload the server, do not exceed 15 workers in your tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the results for three sets of tests where the `max_workers_per_node` was increased all the way to 88. We also varied the number of files in each batch, which effectively alters the degree of parallelism in our code. The result is a figure which looks remarkably like Amdahl's Law!\n",
