    "Interactive plotting is an excellent tool to facilitate data exploration. A very popular tool for creating Interactive maps is [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/). Leaflet is a JavaScript library for mapping, which has wrappers in numerous languages including python (`ipyleaflet`).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous two sessions, we created tiles at the maximum zoom level (z = 13). If you wanted to display all of this data on an interactive map, like a Leaflet map, it would be extremely slow to load because there is so much of it, and it's at such a high resolution. To show this data in a performant way on a map, we need to create _lower_ resolution tiles (\"downsampling\"), and they need to be in a web-accessible format (most browsers can't render GeoTIFF files, so PNG is better.) - [Here is a good explanation](https://www.maptiler.com/google-maps-coordinates-tile-bounds-projection/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will create web tiles as PNG images of those tiles at all zoom levels, from 1 to 13. This way, when we are zoomed _out_ in the interactive map, the _lower_ resolution zoom level 1 is loaded. Higher resolution levels load only when you zoom _in_, and the extent you are trying to view is smaller, so fewer tiles load. This scaling of resolution by zoom level is what allows us to interact with the data in a performant way.\n",
