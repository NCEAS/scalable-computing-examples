    "Parsl and other concurrency libraries generally provide both **blocking** and **non-blocking** methods for accessing the results of asycnchronous method calls. By blocking, we are referring to methods that wait for the asynchronous opearation to complete before returning results, which blocks execution of the rest of a program. By non-blocking, we are referring to methods that return the result if it is available, but not if the async method hasn't completed yet. In that case, it lets the rest of the program to continue execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice this means that we can either 1) wait for all async calls to complete, and then process them using the blocking methods, or 2) query with a non-blocking method to see if each async call is complete, and only then retrieve the results for that method. We illustrate this approach below with parsl."
